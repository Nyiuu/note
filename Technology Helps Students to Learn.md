## 正方反驳观点

Refuting the First Debater of the Negative Side's View that "Technology Reduces Students' Concentration and Autonomous Learning Ability"：

- Although electronic devices have distracting factors, they can be addressed by setting focus modes and using time management software. For example, with the Forest focus app, when students turn it on and use other software during their study time, the virtual sapling will wither, which urges them to focus on learning. Moreover, technology also provides a focused learning environment. Online study rooms allow students to monitor themselves through the camera, creating an immersive learning atmosphere and enhancing their autonomous learning ability.

- "Fast-food learning" is just a partial phenomenon. Many online course platforms offer in-depth series of courses. For instance, the professional skill courses on NetEase Cloud Classroom can last dozens of hours, guiding students to learn systematically and cultivating the habit of in-depth thinking.

Refuting the Second Debater of the Negative Side's View that "Technology Weakens the Mastery of Basic Knowledge and Long-term Learning Effects"：

- Technological tools are supplementary means rather than substitutes for learning. Taking calculators as an example, after mastering the principles of arithmetic operations, using them can improve efficiency and be more accurate in complex calculations. Language learning software helps with memorizing vocabulary and grammar. Through repeated practice, it strengthens memory. Students can also recite classic passages to improve their language abilities. Combining technology with traditional learning methods can better help students master knowledge.

- The reduction in handwriting and memory training is not inevitable. Using digital writing tools such as a graphics tablet in conjunction with handwriting practice software can not only retain the practice of handwriting but also make it convenient to save and review. Additionally, AI-based composition correction not only points out mistakes but also provides writing ideas and improvement suggestions. Long-term use can enhance writing skills and promote the development of critical thinking.

Refuting the Third Debater of the Negative Side's View that "Technology Exacerbates Educational Inequality and Brings Health Problems"：

- Many public welfare organizations and government projects are committed to narrowing the digital divide. For example, the "Rural Education Digitization Plan" equips schools in poverty-stricken areas with electronic devices and the Internet, and provides free online course resources to reduce educational inequality. Meanwhile, some online education platforms have launched a low-traffic learning mode to adapt to students in areas with poor network conditions.

- Regarding health problems, we can set screen usage time reminders and use blue light filtering devices to protect eyesight. Moreover, online learning allows for flexible time arrangement. Students can use fragmented time for learning, reducing sedentary time. They can also combine online fitness courses to exercise while learning, alleviating health issues. The problem of algorithm bias in AI education systems is also being continuously optimized. Developers will use diverse data for training to ensure fairness.

反驳反方辩手一辩“科技降低学生注意力和自主学习能力”的观点：

Technology Reduces Students' Concentration and Autonomous Learning Ability

- Electronic devices are a major source of distraction. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, as well as various mobile games, constantly attract students' attention, making it difficult for them to focus on their studies. For example, a student may intend to study for an hour but end up spending half of that time scrolling through social media feeds.

- Over - reliance on technology weakens students' autonomous learning ability. Many students have become accustomed to simply searching for answers online instead of thinking deeply and exploring problems on their own. In math learning, instead of trying to solve complex problems step by step, some students directly input the questions into math - solving apps.

- The instant feedback provided by technology products leads to "fast - food learning." Students are used to getting quick answers and lack the patience to think deeply. For example, when reading an article, instead of carefully analyzing the text, they may just look for the key points highlighted by digital reading tools.

- The push notifications of smart devices interfere with learning. Frequent beeps of various message notifications often interrupt students' learning train of thought, making it difficult for them to concentrate for a long time. For example, news push notifications and social media messages on mobile phones can cause students to be distracted and check them frequently while studying.

- When learning online, students are easily disturbed by advertisements. Many educational websites or learning apps are full of a large number of advertisements, which distract students' attention from the learning content and affect the continuity of learning.

科技降低学生的注意力和自主学习能力

- 电子设备是分散注意力的主要来源。TikTok 和 Instagram 等社交媒体平台以及各种手机游戏不断吸引学生的注意力，使他们很难专注于学习。例如，一个学生可能打算学习一个小时，但最终却花了一半的时间浏览社交媒体信息。

- 过度依赖科技削弱了学生的自主学习能力。许多学生已经习惯于简单地在线搜索答案，而不是深入思考和自己探索问题。在数学学习中，一些学生不是试图一步一步解决复杂的问题，而是直接将问题输入数学解答应用程序。

- 科技产品提供的即时反馈导致“快餐学习”。学生习惯于快速获得答案，缺乏深入思考的耐心。例如，在阅读文章时，他们可能只是寻找数字阅读工具突出显示的要点，而不是仔细分析文本。

- 智能设备的推送通知干扰学习。各种消息通知的频繁提示音经常会打断学生的学习思路，使他们难以长时间集中注意力。例如，手机上的新闻推送通知和社交媒体消息会导致学生在学习时分心并频繁查看。

- 在网上学习时，学生很容易受到广告的干扰。许多教育网站或学习应用程序充斥着大量广告，分散了学生对学习内容的注意力，影响了学习的连续性。

For instance, students who rarely write by hand may have poor handwriting and slower writing speeds. In math, relying on calculators all the time may weaken their mental arithmetic and calculation abilities.

- Excessive use of technology - assisted tools may lead to a decline in students' critical thinking and creativity. Since they are used to getting ready - made answers or solutions, they have fewer opportunities to think independently and come up with innovative ideas.

- Voice input replacing handwriting leads to a serious phenomenon of students forgetting how to write Chinese characters when they pick up a pen, and their Chinese character writing ability deteriorates. For example, many students are accustomed to using the voice-to-text function in daily communication and rarely write by hand, so they are likely to make spelling mistakes in exams.

- The excessive use of intelligent tutoring software makes students lack the process of independent thinking. For example, with math problem-solving software, students directly obtain the answers without understanding the problem-solving principles, and they will have difficulty dealing with changed question types.

科技削弱基础知识的掌握，降低长期学习效果

- 计算器、翻译软件和 ChatGPT 等人工智能生成的内容，使学生依赖科技解决问题，而不是真正理解知识的本质和逻辑。在语言学习中，过度依赖翻译软件可能会阻碍学生真正掌握语法和词汇的使用。

- 书写和记忆训练的减少导致学生数学、阅读和写作的基本技能下降。例如，很少用手写的学生可能书写不好，书写速度较慢。在数学方面，一直依赖计算器可能会削弱他们的心算和计算能力。

- 过度使用技术辅助工具可能会导致学生的批判性思维和创造力下降。由于他们习惯于获得现成的答案或解决方案，他们独立思考和提出创新想法的机会更少。

- 语音输入取代手写，导致学生拿起笔就忘字的现象严重，汉字书写能力下降。例如，很多学生在日常交流中习惯使用语音转文字功能，很少手写，考试时容易出现拼写错误。

- 智能辅导软件的过度使用，使学生缺乏独立思考的过程。例如，使用数学解题软件，学生直接得到答案，不了解解题原理，对变化的题型处理困难。
